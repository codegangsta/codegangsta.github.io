The day finally has arrived. I am starting a blog.

## Introduction

For those of you who do not know me, my name is Jeremy Saenz. I have been building software since graduating high school. Discovering that I did not want to attend college, I naturally picked up software engineering as a passionate craft that I care deeply about.

Back in 2008 I was just starting to wade (drown perhaps is the better word) through the vast sea of knowledge that is the software engineering industry. I began my journey by programming Adobe Flex apps with Actionscript 3. To ease the pain of entering an industry completely void of prior relationships and contacts, I decided to create a gangsta-rap video that was related to tech (Flex specifically).

Thus, the Flex Gangsta was born!

## The Flex Gangsta

The video instantly propelled me into the industry. In all humbleness and honesty it was a scary time for me. I was gracefully accepted into as a community member when I did not *really* know how to write code!

With the help of some wonderful mentors I eventually *did* learn how to write code, and write it well. I began speaking at conferences and continued to produce rap songs and videos for the fun of it.

## Recently...

The last couple years yielded an abundance of knowledge and experience, ranging from building key modules for a large social game to designing and implementing a full fledged driving game that is deployed/featured at auto shows across the country.

My more recent endeavor (~1yr) has been working with the fantastic team over at [The Engine Co.](http://theengine.co/) The team has been tirelessly working to deliver a rapid and pragmatic workflow/platform for developing cross-platform mobile games. Loom, our flagship product, has recently launched and is building a strong community of developers dedicated to make this platform a lasting value to the mobile games industry.

At The Engine Co. our driving philosophy is to use the best tool for the job. Building a tooling workflow and development platform requires us to touch Java, Obj-C, C, C++, Ruby, C#, and LoomScript (our homegrown language) to get the job done right.

Today I am touching many different technologies, and thus I change my alias from the **Flex Gangsta** to **Code Gangsta**. The purpose of this blog is to document some solutions I discover in my day to day. 

Thanks for joining me on this adventure, now let's write some software!
