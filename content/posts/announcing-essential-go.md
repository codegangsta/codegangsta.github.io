About a month ago I spread the word via friends and Twitter that I've released a new online video course called [Essential Go](https://www.kajabinext.com/marketplace/courses/1-essential-go).

If you haven't already heard about it, [Essential Go](https://www.kajabinext.com/marketplace/courses/1-essential-go) is quick and easy way to get your feet wet with all of the essential features of the Go programming language.

The reception so far has been awesome! One piece of feedback I hear quite often is that I am not charging enough for the course. The honest truth is that I am much more interested in moving the Go community forward as a whole than I am in making this screencast thing a full blown business.

I want to make this course as accessible as possible to those who want to learn go through polished video training, so I've set the price at $15.00 and it is likely to stay that way.

I am also in the process of adding even more content to the screencast. Over the next week I will be finishing up the bonus lessons on basic concurrency using goroutines, channels, and the select statement.

I'm really excited to produce more of these screencasts in the future. If you are interested in supporting more screencasts, go ahead and check out [Essential Go](https://www.kajabinext.com/marketplace/courses/1-essential-go) or subscribe to my <a href="#" data-mp-popup-trigger>Email List</a>.
