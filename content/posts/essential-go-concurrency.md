You guys asked for it and now it's finally here! I just updated [Essential Go](https://www.kajabinext.com/marketplace/courses/1-essential-go) with a 5 part bonus series on concurrency in Go.

If you already own [Essential Go](https://www.kajabinext.com/marketplace/courses/1-essential-go) then you already have the new videos waiting for you in the course. If you haven't already purchased [Essential Go](https://www.kajabinext.com/marketplace/courses/1-essential-go), now is the perfect time. ($15.00 is an absolute steal)
